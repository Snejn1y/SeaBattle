# SeaBattleGame
This is a console implementation of the classic game Sea Battle, also known as Sea Battle.

## Rules of the game
Each player has a 10x10 board on which to place their ships. The board is marked with a grid of cells, which are labeled with a number and a digit. For example, the square (0; 0) is in the upper left corner of the board, and (9; 9) is in the lower right corner.

Each player has four types of ships:

+ Battleship (4 cells) - 1 piece
+ Cruiser (3 cells) - 2 pieces
+ Submarine (2 cells) - 3 pieces
+ Destroyer (1 cell) - 4 pieces

Players take turns firing at opposing ships, naming the cell on the board. If the square contains a part of a ship, the opponent must say "hit". Otherwise, the opponent says "miss". The game continues until one of the players loses all his ships. The player who loses all his ships loses the game.
